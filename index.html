            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">I’m grateful for your dedication to a culture that fosters individuality, taking chances, and giving a damn. My time at Primitive has allowed me an amazing opportunity to grow professionally, learn from others, and chase other dreams all at the same time. Thank you for taking a chance on me! Happy Birthday! - <br><br> - Austin</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">Kade is an extremely charismatic individual who accomplishes any goal he sets out to achieve. I’m so thankful that he and Lacey had the passion to pursue Primitive and make their dream a reality. This is a fantastic company and it wouldn’t be possible without Kade!<br><br> - Larae</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">A lot of people say dreamers often have their head in the clouds while neglecting the path directly in front of them.<br><br>

                (Well, actually, I’ve never heard anyone say that, but for the sake of argument let’s just say everyone does and move on.)
                <br><br>
                The reason “a lot of people” say this is because it’s so unusual to exhibit the practical qualities we all need to keep the needle moving forward, while also freely swaying with a vibrancy only found in ones own imagination. However, Kade lives and breathes both and thrives in a rarefied air that only those who were born to lead, can. It is an ongoing honor and a blessing to be part of a community, a culture, and a company led by the highest watermark of leadership, support, and care.
                <br><br>
                Thanks and “Go Buffs” ( or something.)<br><br> - Leisa
            </p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">I am so grateful for your leadership and your patience. It is such a pleasure to get to work along side of you each day and I am so thankful to you for adding me to such a talented Primitive team. <br><br> - Jordan</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">Kade’s ability to motivate others and get them to see/believe their potential is something that has had a huge impact on me over my time at Primitive. I am grateful for his drive, his ability to see past the “now”, and his confidence in Primitive and its employees. <br><br> - Sydney</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">Kade is, by far, the most talented leader and boss I’ve ever had the privilege to work with. I constantly learn things from him that stretch and grow me, enabling me to operate in my natural strengths and gifts in new ways. Kade is humble and able to own his weakness and shortcomings, which is incredibly rare. He challenges me to work hard and be better just by the example he sets. I am so thankful that he had the vision he did for Primitive 9 years ago and built it into what it is today. I feel humbled that I have the opportunity to be along for the ride and hope I never take it for granted!  <br><br> - Annie</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">I am thankful for your leadership and the opportunities you have given me. I have had the privilege of seeing Primitive grow and have gotten grow in my craft along with it. I am grateful that you took a chance on me when you didn’t have to, thank you for all that you do.  <br><br> - Morgan M</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">Kade has really helped me get to where I am today. He was the first person I really looked up to outside of my parents. He’s been extremely influential to me. He’s a one of a kind guy that has an idea for everything and the drive to make any of those ideas into reality. Tell him he can’t do something and he will for sure get it done. <br><br> - Matthew</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">Kade, thanks for being such an amazing leader! I am so grateful to work for someone with such a strong work ethic. We are all lucky to have a boss like you! Happy Birthday! <br><br> - Rayann</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4">Kade, I am so grateful that almost five years ago, you started working on me to come and join the primitive team. What a difference you and my work at Primitive has made to me and my family. It has given me opportunities I never thought possible. I never realized I could have work where I could grow and learn and be so proud of the work of my hand. I love that you are thoughtful, generous, always patient and appreciative of me! <br><br> - Love, Liz</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4"><span class="italic text-xs">In a British Accent that makes all the girls swoon</span> Happy Birthday, dude! You are truly an inspirational man, always moving, always improving. Thanks for everything you do for us!  <br><br> - Dillion</p>
            <p class="tracking-wider text-white pt-4 pb-4"><span class="italic text-xs">Back to the standard Texas drawl</span> Kade is something extremely inspiring to me. He is one of those near super humans you hear about but don’t come across very often. Quitting is not ever an option for him and he’s always pushing so hard to keep Primitive growing and reaching new levels. Something I really value is his willingness to be transparent with his employees and how everyone’s opinion is valued. If it were not for Kade and Primitive, I’m not sure how weathering this Covid mess would have gone for me, so I am truly grateful for the opportunity to be here with all these amazing people. Happy birthday Kade!! <br><br> - Jeremy</p>
